Design Patterns to use:
  - Abstract Factory
    - for UI

  - invert diagram
    - UI above
    - objects (case, interview, etc.) under

- have portals all be aligned
- have arrows all go towards the center at 90deg, then go up straight
- start all arrows from cardinal directions
  - make all lines vertical or horizontal

- on UI
  - have 'createUI' abstract (User Portal)
    - override in subclasses
      -have private methods 'create...' (such as 'createNotifications') to create each component of UI
