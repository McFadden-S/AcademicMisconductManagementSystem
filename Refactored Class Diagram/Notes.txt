    - objects (case, interview, etc.) under

- have portals all be aligned

- start all arrows from cardinal directions
  - make all lines vertical or horizontal

- on UI
  - have 'createUI' abstract (User Portal)
    - override in subclasses
      -have private methods 'create...' (such as 'createNotifications') to create each component of UI
      
- add a get userActorGroup method to User Portal
