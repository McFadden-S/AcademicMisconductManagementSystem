Shae McFadden's Notes

Requirements Analysis
  System
    Functional
      Implement the Academic Misconduct Process defined by SCO
      Log all actions taken place in the process(w/ time stamp and user who performed them)
      Ability to schedule:
        interviews (investigation and Lamp) for Department Misconduct Team
        hearings for SCO
      Add additional information to the case:
        additional evidence; interview summary, notes and student attendance; case status;
      Send relevant information to the student:
      Change Status of the case
      Refer the case to appropriate team for that stage
        Module Leader -> Academic Misconduct Team -> Department Misconduct Team -> SCO -> Professional Services Team
    Non Functional
      flexible as possible (?potential agile development)
      Have user log in
        each user be able to pick current cases and view which actions are required of them
        only display cases which the user is relevant in
        with log in then easy to automate user and time stamp on log
      for scheduling (under specific case)
        have form to select type of event along with location and issue invites to participants
        have system to allow for changes in scheduling and responses from participants including confirmation(RSVP) or submit a mitigating circumstance for date change
    Use Case

        register case
      If case has enough evidence then System decides path based on type of misconduct and if their is past offences
    Ambiguous/Incomplete Requirements
      where should logged actions be stored in the system(?in the Case)
      what action should be taken if a case does not have enough evidence (? not enough evidence reported back to Module leader or dropped)
      Do students have access to the system to see status on the case (? things that are not specified as sent by email, if student has access would they see it on the system)
      are SCA and SCO the same
      What happens when a case is closed or dropped (?is all or some information kept)
      Are the academic management team apart of the SCO

      refer case to SCO
      In Case of 3rd Party Involvement (no previous offences)
        Set up investigation interview (sends invite to module leader, member of misconduct team and student)
        Summary of the interview is added to the case and emailed to student

          request for any corrections from student
          notify the professional services team
            the professional services team send copy of signed form to module leader and SCO
        If no case then case is dropped

  Write use case descriptions.
Part One Report:
  Team management and process:
    Describe team membersâ€™ roles and their contributions to the project;
