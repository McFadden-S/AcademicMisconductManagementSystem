		Record Time Stamp and User who performed them.
-	Schedule Interviews (Investigation and Lamp) for department Misconduct Team, hearings for SCO.
-	Send relevant information to the student.
-	Send Emails.
-	View multiple cases and see which actions are currently required from the user in them.
-	Change status of the case.
		Cases can be closed, registered (closed but no action) and dropped.
-	Refer the case to the appropriate team for that stage.
-	All cases are kept even if they are dropped.

Should have: Important requirements that are not vital but add Significant value to the project.
-	Notify/request other user of actions required of the case.
-	For scheduling, have a form to select the type of event along with location and issue invites to participants, different interview types may have different requirements to schedule.
